# HMP2Data_Methods

## Purpose of Project

* MOMS-PI Qiime Pipeline
    + Most data for the MOMS-PI project was processed through the Qiime pipeline
    + However, data for the vaginal microbiome were not correctly processed through this pipeline
* Stirrups File
    + Correctly processed vaginal microbiome sequence data
    + Project data however is not preprocessed
* Project Aims
    + Preprocess this Stirrups data
    + Release each preprocessed portion as an RDA file available for public download
    + Release a cleaned phyloseq object for the data that encapsulates all portions of the data into one
    + Allow for researchers to replicate these methods and adjust methods as they see fit
    
## Downloading the data

All publicly available stirrups data were downloaded from the Human Microbiome Project Data Portal (https://portal.hmpdacc.org/) on 01/03/2020. Specifically, "Project: Integrative Human Microbiome Project" was selected, followed by the selection of the study "MOMS-PI" (Multi-Omics Microbiome Study - Pregnancy Initiative). Subsequent filters were applied to obtain "stirrups profile" data (16S data with VCU vaginal custom data base community assignment) in txt format. 

The data were downloaded using Aspera client `Aspera cli` (availavle as a shell script  ibm-aspera-cli-*-release.sh from https://downloads.asperasoft.com/en/downloads/62). See instructions on how to execute a shell script (https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/run-execute-sh-shell-script/, https://askubuntu.com/questions/38661/how-do-i-run-sh-scripts or similar) to install `Aspera cli`. Once Aspera client is properly installed, an executable file `ascp` should be visible in your `/Users/ekaterinasmirnova/Applications/Aspera\ CLI/bin/` folder.  

The shell scripts used to download the data are available in the `Scripts/` folder. 

Detailed instructions on data download are documented in the `init_rmd.Rmd` file.

## Processing downloaded data

Each sample is downloaded as a separate file, which needs to be further reshaped into the single file (long format) that combines all samples using the set of unic commands documented in `UnixScript.rtf` file in the `Scripts/` folder. 

The 16S is typically formatted for statistical analysis as a taxa table with taxa in rows and samples in columns. The script used to concert the long format `MOMS_Cleaning.R` into a taxa table is available in the `Scripts/` folder. 

Detailed instructions on using the unix `UnixScript.rtf` and `R`  `MOMS_Cleaning.R` scripts are available in `init_rmd.Rmd` file in the `Scripts/` folder.
